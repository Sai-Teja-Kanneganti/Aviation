# Aviation
@ National Weather Center

In this project, an ADS-B receiver receives live streaming data from all aircrafts within 150-mile radius. DHCP connection is established to receive data. Text mining techniques are applied on the received data to parse and obtain required fields. Then data is prepared for visualization. This project is implemented in python. Later by using Mapbox (Data Visualization tool) & HTML able to track and visualize aircrafts.

Whem Aviation.py is executed, it uses localhost.bat to create a local host connection & map.template to create html file that is being displayed in browser to visualize aircrafts.
